            <p>
                <li>1931 - Richard Alpert is born in Boston, MA into a wealthy Jewish family</li>
                <li>1958 - After graduating from Stanford with a doctorate in Psychology, Richard accepted a professor position at Harvard and went on to become the youngest tenured professor at Harvard at that time</li>
                <li>1960 - Richard meets Timothy Leary, a fellow professor at Harvard, through his work on the exploration of consciousness. Tim Leary tells
                    Richard about his experience with magic (psilocybin) mushrooms in Mexico and is quoted as saying he "learned more about ... (his) brain and its possibilities ... [and] more about psychology in the five hours after taking these mushrooms than ... in the preceding 15 years of studying and doing research in psychology."</li>
                <li>1960 (cont) - Richard, likely intrigued with what he's learned from Tim Leary, acquires synthetic psilocybin through Tim and has his first psychedelic experience during which he experienced several spiritual and psychological revelations and higher states of consciousness. This began a new era in Richard's life</li>
                <li>1960 (cont) - Richard and Timothy Leary launch the Harvard Psilocybin Project, a series of experiments in psychology based around the administration of psilocybin</li>
                <li>1962 - Tim Leary and Richard open the International Federation for Internal Freedom in Cambridge, MA in order to carry out studies in the religious use of psychedelic drugs</li>
                <li>1963 - Richard and Timothy Leary are kicked out of Harvard; Dass for administering psilocybin to an undergraduate student and Leary for not giving required lectures</li>
                <li>1963 (cont) - Richard, Tim Leary, and some of their followers relocate to the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York to establish a communal group with whom to continue psychedelic studies. The group took LSD and psilocybin regularly and were often visited by celebrities</li>
                <li>1964 - Richard and Tim Leary publish <i>The Psychedlic Expericence</i> with Ralph Metzner based on the <i>Tibetan Book of Dead</i>
                <li>1967 - Feeling depressed and spritually unsatisfied with what his life had become, Richard traveled to India with a friend, on a whim, and eventually met Bhagavan Das (aka Kermit Michael Riggs) who introduced him to the man that would ultimately become his guru, Neem Karoli Baba, a Hindu Saint, at Kainchi ashram. Neem Karoli Baba tells Richards exactly how his (Richard's) mother died earlier in the year.This blows Richard's mind because from his perspective, there is no way this stranger should have that information as he'd never met him before. He he could not figure out a reasonable or logical explanation for how this could be possible. He states, "my mind just gave up. It burned out its circuitry... All I could say is it felt like I was home. The journey was over."</li>
                <li>1970 - Richard returns to India, this time for a year and a half, and continues his study of Hinduism, Buddhism, meditation, Yoga, and various other spiritual traditions. Neem Karoli Baba gifts Richard Alpert with the name 'Ram Dass' which means <i>"servant of God".</i> 
                <li>Ram Dass begins writing a book about what he's learned to share with the Western world</li>
                <li>1971 - The book that Ram Dass has been writing is published. It is titled "Be Here Now", a lesson that he originaly learned from Bhagavan Das. The book goes on to sell some 200,000 copies and is coveted as a spiritual manual for many Americans on spiritual journeys during the 1960s</li>
                <li>1997 - Ram Dass suffers a stroke that leaves him with limited mobility and communication abilities. He admits that at first this was frustrating for him but he now interprets the stroke as an act of grace and an opportunity for him to get closer to God. He continued to offer teachings to the millions of souls he has reached until he passed on in 2020.</li>
